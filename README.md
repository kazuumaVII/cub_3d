# cub_3d

## Introduction 🤔
This project is inspired by the world-famous 90’s game Wolfeinstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever. 
It will enable to explore ray-casting. My goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way

The project runs using the MiniLibX, a simplified version of the Xlib. It can therefore only run in MacOSX, preferably on a computer with a solid CPU !
